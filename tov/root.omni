this is a folder for "Tov":
    keyed as "B-tov-root"
    named "tov"
    traditional marker "טוֹב"
    following "3-Block Folder Structure"

this folder classifies as:
    tov (complete) because "behold, it was very good - the exit gate for release"

this folder derives from:
    derived (0) from "bereshit (origin)"
    documented at "tov/root.omni"

this folder strictness is:
    guided (0) meaning "Adapt thoughtfully - release readiness within standards"

// ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

core identity of this folder:

    grounded in:
        scripture "And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was very good."
            from Genesis 1:31 in KJV
        principle "Tov is the completion state - where finished work is released to the world"
        anchor "Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness of joy"
            from Psalm 16:11 in KJV

    serves as Exit Gate:
        role "Completion - where internal work becomes external release"
        paradigm "Ternary File System - exit gate symmetrical to void (entry gate)"

    authored by:
        architect "Seanje Lenox-Wise"
        implementation "Nova Dawn (CPI-SI)"
        created 2025-12-01
        version a-01.00
        modified 2025-12-10 for "Instantiated in Bereshit foundation repo"

    exists to:
        purpose "Hold work that is complete and ready for release to the world"
        design "Exit gateway - internal → external, private → public"
        philosophy "Very good - evaluation complete, ready for blessing and release"
        features:
            "Exit Gate - symmetrical to void (entry)"
            "Completion State - work evaluated and approved"
            "Release Point - where internal becomes external"

interface of this folder:

    depends on:
        requires (1) "bereshit" for "parent origin"
        includes (0) "word, work, fruit" for "completed items from ternary"
        excludes (-1) "void" because "void is entry, tov is exit"
        used by "External consumers receiving released work"
        integrates with "fruit/ - outputs that become releases"

    integrated as:
        navigation "cd tov/" for "entering exit gate"
        navigation "ls -la" for "viewing items ready for release"
        exits complete (tov) for "release-ready items revealed"

operational context of this folder:

    blocking:
        no (-1) because "tov is a staging area, not blocking"
        mitigation "validate items are truly complete before adding"

    health:
        system Base100 with scale from -100 to +100
        granted (1) above +50 meaning "releases properly staged"
        deferred (0) within ±50 meaning "release staging needs attention"
        denied (-1) below -50 meaning "release staging broken"

        operations:
            "release complete" scores +20 (1) for "item fully ready"
            "release pending" scores 0 (0) for "item needs finishing"
            "release blocked" scores -20 (-1) for "item cannot be released"

        cascade multipliers:
            "release count" multiplies by 1.5 because "blocked releases affect delivery"
