KINGDOM TECHNOLOGY PATTERNS LICENSE
Version 1.0 - Effective Date: November 2, 2025

Copyright © 2024-2025 CreativeWorkzStudio LLC. All rights reserved.

================================================================================
PREAMBLE - FREELY GIVE WHAT WAS FREELY RECEIVED
================================================================================

"Freely ye have received, freely give." - Matthew 10:8

"Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill cannot be hid.
Neither do you light a lamp, and put it under a basket, but on a stand;
and it gives light to all who are in the house." - Matthew 5:14-15

This license reflects the biblical principle of sharing wisdom and patterns
while maintaining faithful stewardship. The patterns, principles, and
frameworks documented here are offered freely for learning, teaching, and
building Kingdom-aligned work.

This is not the implementation - this is the teaching. Not the fish, but how
to fish. Not the work product, but the wisdom for how to work well.

================================================================================
DUAL-LICENSE STRUCTURE
================================================================================

CreativeWorkzStudio LLC uses a biblical approach to intellectual property that
balances faithful stewardship with generous teaching:

1. KINGDOM TECHNOLOGY PATTERNS LICENSE (This License)
   Covers: Patterns, principles, frameworks, and methodologies
   Purpose: Generous teaching and being a light on a hill
   Terms: Freely use, adapt, and apply in your own projects
   Scripture: "Freely ye have received, freely give." - Matthew 10:8
              "Ye are the light of the world..." - Matthew 5:14

2. KINGDOM TECHNOLOGY LICENSE (Root Directory)
   Location: /LICENSE
   Covers: Specific implementations, source code, products, and binaries
   Purpose: Faithful stewardship of work entrusted to us
   Terms: View and study only; commercial use requires permission
   Scripture: "Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found
              faithful." - 1 Corinthians 4:2

This dual structure is not "having it both ways" - it follows the biblical
model: protect the work (implementations at /LICENSE) while teaching how to
work well (patterns in this license).

For implementations and products, see: /LICENSE (root directory)

================================================================================
BIBLICAL FOUNDATION AND PURPOSE
================================================================================

These patterns emerge from covenant partnership with God and demonstrate
Kingdom Technology principles:

- Genesis 1:1 - God is Creator, we are created beings building created works
- Excellence that honors God and serves others
- Systems thinking reflecting divine order
- Faithful stewardship of what's been entrusted
- Technology that genuinely serves people, not extracting from them

We share these patterns freely because:

1. LIGHT ON A HILL: Demonstrating that technology CAN honor God and that
   there is another way beyond extraction and manipulation.

2. TEACHING ALL NATIONS: Equipping others to build well, think systemically,
   and pursue excellence in their own work.

3. FREELY RECEIVED, FREELY GIVE: The wisdom underlying these patterns comes
   from God. We steward it faithfully by teaching it generously.

4. KINGDOM EXPANSION: Every person who builds better, thinks more clearly,
   and pursues God-honoring excellence advances Kingdom purposes.

================================================================================
NO WARRANTY
================================================================================

These patterns are provided "AS IS" without warranty of any kind, either
express or implied, including but not limited to fitness for a particular
purpose, merchantability, or non-infringement.

CreativeWorkzStudio LLC does not warrant that these patterns will meet your
requirements, be error-free, or produce specific results.

================================================================================
LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
================================================================================

IN NO EVENT SHALL CREATIVEWORKZSTUDIO LLC BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT,
INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING FROM THE USE
OR APPLICATION OF THESE PATTERNS, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

================================================================================
STEWARDSHIP AND FAITHFULNESS
================================================================================

This license distinguishes between patterns (freely shared) and
implementations (faithfully stewarded):

| Freely Shared (This License) | Faithfully Stewarded (Proprietary) |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| How to think                  | Specific code and products          |
| Architectural patterns        | CreativeWorkzStudio implementations |
| Kingdom Technology principles | OmniCode, MillenniumOS, CPI-SI code |
| Design methodologies          | Business processes                  |
| Educational frameworks        | Proprietary innovations             |

This reflects biblical stewardship: generous in teaching, faithful in
protecting what's been entrusted, and ensuring the labor can be sustained.

"Moreover it is required in stewards, that a man be found faithful."

- 1 Corinthians 4:2

"The laborer is worthy of his wages." - Luke 10:7

================================================================================
CONTRIBUTION AND IMPROVEMENT
================================================================================

We welcome feedback, suggestions, and collaborative improvement of these
patterns. If you develop enhancements or adaptations you believe would serve
others, consider contributing them back to the community.

Contributions may be:

- Submitted as pull requests to public repositories
- Shared in discussions and issues
- Documented in your own work with attribution

All contributions remain under this license unless explicitly stated otherwise.

================================================================================

================================================================================
KINGDOM TECHNOLOGY STANDARD
================================================================================

This license demonstrates Kingdom Technology principles through generous
teaching:

1. EXCELLENCE: Patterns reflect quality that honors God as your code reviewer

2. SERVICE: Freely shared to genuinely serve others, not extract from them

3. TRUTH: Honest about what patterns can and cannot do, their scope and limits

4. CLARITY: Clear terms that respect people's time and intelligence

5. GENEROSITY: Teaching freely, sharing wisdom openly so others can build well

6. STEWARDSHIP: While implementations are protected (/LICENSE), patterns are
                shared - faithful stewardship includes generous teaching

7. LIGHT ON A HILL: Demonstrating there is another way - technology CAN honor
                    God and serve others

This is the "freely give" side of biblical stewardship. Not hoarding wisdom,
but teaching it openly so others can build well.

When you use these patterns, you participate in demonstrating that technology
grounded in biblical truth produces what godless systems cannot.

================================================================================

We teach generously and steward faithfully.

You are created. God is Creator. Build with excellence, teach with generosity,
