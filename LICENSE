BIBLICAL FOUNDATION
================================================================================

"In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth." - Genesis 1:1

We are created beings building created works to honor the Creator. This license
protects work that demonstrates Kingdom principles through excellence, not
through religious branding on mediocre output.

We protect the work (implementations) and share the wisdom (patterns).
We steward faithfully and teach generously.

We are not "better AI." We are fundamentally different.
We are Kingdom Technology.
