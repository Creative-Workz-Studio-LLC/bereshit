// ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

this is a folder for "Word":
    keyed as "B-word-root"
    named "word"
    traditional marker "def"
    following "3-Block Folder Structure"

this folder classifies as:
    word (1) because "containing definitions, specifications, source of truth"

this folder derives from:
    origin (∞) because "child of the ternary root"
    documented at "word/root.omni"

this folder strictness is:
    tight (1) meaning "Follow exactly - definitions are authoritative"

// ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

core identity of this folder:

    grounded in:
        scripture "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made."
            from John 1:1,3 in KJV
        principle "The Word (Logos) is the definition from which all things are made"
        anchor "whose seed is in itself"
            from Genesis 1:12 in KJV

    serves as Word:
        role "Source of truth - definitions that instantiate into work"
        paradigm "Ternary File System - Word/Work/Fruit"

    authored by:
        architect "Seanje Lenox-Wise"
        implementation "Nova Dawn (CPI-SI)"
        created 2025-11-30
        version a-01.00
        modified 2025-12-10 for "Instantiated in Bereshit foundation repo"

    exists to:
        purpose "Contain authoritative definitions that work implements"
        design "Organized by domain - specifications, standards, templates, schemas"
        philosophy "What is defined here is the source of truth for instantiation"
        features:
            "Authoritative - this is the source of truth"
            "Stable - changes slowly and deliberately"
            "Referenced - other things point here for definition"

interface of this folder:

    depends on:
        requires (1) "bereshit/" for "ternary root containment"
        includes (0) "word/work/" for "instantiation of definitions"
        includes (0) "tov/fruit/" for "derivations from instantiated work"
        excludes (-1) "implementations" because "implementations belong in word/work/"
        used by "Development processes, build systems, documentation generation"
        integrates with "work/ receives definitions, fruit/ receives outputs"

    integrated as:
        navigation "cd word/" for "entering definitions"
        navigation "ls -la" for "viewing definition categories"
        exits word (1) for "definitions found and referenced"

operational context of this folder:

    blocking:
        yes (1) because "definitions must be stable before work proceeds"
        mitigation "version definitions, communicate changes to work/"

    health:
        system Base100 with scale from -100 to +100
        granted (1) above +50 meaning "definitions clear and complete"
        deferred (0) within ±50 meaning "definitions need refinement"
        denied (-1) below -50 meaning "definitions unclear or conflicting"

        operations:
            "definition complete" scores +20 (1) for "fully specified"
            "definition draft" scores 0 (0) for "in progress"
            "definition missing" scores -20 (-1) for "gap in coverage"

        cascade multipliers:
            "work/ alignment" multiplies by 1.5 because "misaligned work amplifies definition issues"
