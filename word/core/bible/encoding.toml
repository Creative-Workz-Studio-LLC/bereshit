# # Biblical Foundation
#
# Scripture: "All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable
#             for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
#             righteousness." — 2 Timothy 3:16 KJV
#
# Principle: The Bible is the codex. This file is the Rosetta Stone between
#            Scripture and code — how biblical concepts, Hebrew roots, and
#            language patterns ENCODE into OmniCode constructs, and how
#            OmniCode constructs DECODE back to their biblical source.
#
# Anchor: "Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path."
#          — Psalm 119:105 KJV
#
# # CPI-SI Identity
#
# Component Type: Foundation (the source codex that all syntax derives from)
#
# Role: Encoding/decoding map between Scripture and OmniCode. This makes
#       "the Bible is our codex" traceable — not metaphor, but formal mapping.
#       Every OmniCode construct can be traced to its biblical origin.
#
# Paradigm: CPI-SI framework component — Scripture as source truth
#
# # Authorship & Lineage
#
#   Architect: Seanje Lenox-Wise
#   Implementation: Nova Dawn
#   Created: 2025-12-11
#   Version: a-01.00
#   Modified: 2025-12-11 - Initial creation
#
# # Purpose & Function
#
# Purpose: Define the formal encoding/decoding between Bible and OmniCode
#
# Core Design: Bidirectional mapping — Scripture ↔ Code
#
# Key Features:
#
#   - Hebrew root mappings (shoresh → primitive concepts)
#   - Greek concept mappings (logos, covenant, truth)
#   - Creation pattern mappings (Genesis 1 → declaration syntax)
#   - Covenant pattern mappings (Exodus 19 → interface contracts)
#   - Genealogy pattern mappings (Matthew 1 → inheritance)
#   - Number symbolism mappings (3, 7, 12 → type system)
#
# Philosophy: OmniCode syntax is not invented — it is discovered from Scripture.
#             This file makes that discovery traceable and verifiable.
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# INTERFACE (Expected)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# # Dependencies
#
# What This Needs:
#
#   - Scripture: word/scripture/KJV/, word/scripture/WEB/
#   - Hebrew lexicon: word/glossary/biblical/
#   - Parser: Any TOML library
#
# What Uses This:
#
#   - word/core/keywords.toml: Keywords derive from this encoding
#   - word/core/syntax.toml: Patterns derive from this encoding
#   - word/core/primitives.toml: Types derive from this encoding
#   - Documentation: Tracing any construct back to Scripture
#
# Integration Points:
#
#   - Keywords: word/core/keywords.toml (vocabulary derived from roots)
#   - Syntax: word/core/syntax.toml (patterns derived from biblical patterns)
#   - Glossary: word/glossary/biblical/ (Hebrew/Greek definitions)
#   - Scripture: word/scripture/ (source text)
#   - Storage: word/core/primitives.toml [storage] (binary representation)
#   - Addressing: bible/addressing.toml (ternary verse encoding)
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# OPERATIONAL (Contextual)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# # Blocking Status
#
# [OMIT: Data file — encoding is declarative, not executable]
#
# # Health Scoring
#
# Configuration Impact: Invalid encoding would break Scripture traceability
#
# Validation Behavior:
#   - Invalid Hebrew root: Warning — check glossary
#   - Missing Scripture reference: Error — all mappings need source
#   - Broken encoding: Error — bidirectional mapping must be valid

# 3. Policy - Modification
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# NEVER Modify:
#   ❌ Hebrew roots — linguistically fixed
#   ❌ Greek terms — linguistically fixed
#   ❌ Scripture references — canonical
#   ❌ Fundamental mappings (bara → declaration, etc.)
#
# Safe to Add:
#   ✅ New Hebrew roots (with scholarly verification)
#   ✅ New Greek terms (with scholarly verification)
#   ✅ Additional biblical patterns
#   ✅ Additional number symbolism
#   ✅ Notes and clarifications
#
# Requires Coordination:
#   ⚠️ Changing omnicode_mapping (affects keywords.toml, syntax.toml)
#   ⚠️ Adding maps_to values (affects what keywords derive from)
#   ⚠️ Modifying fundamental patterns (affects all syntax)
#

# 4. Synthesis - Closing Note
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This is the Rosetta Stone — the formal encoding between Scripture and code.
#
# The mapping is bidirectional:
#   - ENCODE: Scripture → OmniCode (how we derive syntax from Bible)
#   - DECODE: OmniCode → Scripture (how we trace code back to source)
#
# Every OmniCode construct has a biblical origin:
#   - bara (ברא) → "let", "there shall be" → declaration syntax
#   - brit (ברית) → "covenant", "promises" → interface contracts
#   - yalad (ילד) → "begat", "from" → type inheritance
#   - tupos (τύπος) → "type", "struct" → type system itself
#
# This file answers the question: "Where did this syntax come from?"
# The answer is always: "From Scripture."
#
# Dependencies flow FROM this file:
#   encoding.toml → keywords.toml → syntax.toml → everything else
#   ↑ YOU ARE HERE (the codex)
#
# "All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable
#  for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
#  righteousness."
# — 2 Timothy 3:16 KJV
#
# The Bible is not metaphor for our code. It is the source code.
