#
# # Biblical Foundation
#
# Scripture: "For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line
#             upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little."
#             — Isaiah 28:10 KJV
#
# Principle: The same truth can be expressed in different forms. KJV preserves
#            the archaic, formal, time-tested language (encoded). WEB provides
#            modern, accessible, clear language (decoded). Both carry the same
#            truth — this file maps between them.
#
# Anchor: "The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a furnace
#          of earth, purified seven times." — Psalm 12:6 KJV
#
# # CPI-SI Identity
#
# Component Type: Rung (translation bridge between two Bible versions)
#
# Role: Translation mapping between KJV and WEB. KJV is the "encoded" form
#       (archaic, preserved, formal). WEB is the "decoded" form (modern,
#       accessible, clear). This file maps vocabulary and phrases between them.
#
# Paradigm: CPI-SI framework component — translation as encoding/decoding
#
# # Authorship & Lineage
#
#   Architect: Seanje Lenox-Wise
#   Implementation: Nova Dawn
#   Created: 2025-12-11
#   Version: a-01.00
#   Modified: 2025-12-11 - Initial creation
#
# # Purpose & Function
#
# Purpose: Map between KJV (encoded) and WEB (decoded) Bible translations
#
# Core Design: Bidirectional mapping — KJV ↔ WEB
#
# Key Features:
#
#   - Pronoun mapping (thou/thee/thy → you/your)
#   - Verb form mapping (hast/hath/doth → have/has/does)
#   - Archaic vocabulary (wherefore, verily, begat → why, truly, fathered)
#   - Phrase mapping (common expressions in both translations)
#   - Theological term mapping (terms that changed or stayed same)
#
# Philosophy: Same truth, different accessibility. KJV carries the weight
#             of tradition. WEB opens that truth to modern readers. Both valid.
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# INTERFACE (Expected)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# # Dependencies
#
# What This Needs:
#
#   - KJV Scripture: word/scripture/KJV/
#   - WEB Scripture: word/scripture/WEB/
#   - Parser: Any TOML library
#
# What Uses This:
#
#   - Scripture display: Show KJV with WEB explanation
#   - Documentation: Use KJV for quotes, WEB for clarity
#   - Search: Find verse in either translation
#   - Learning: Understand archaic terms
#
# Integration Points:
#
#   - KJV: word/scripture/KJV/ (source of encoded text)
#   - WEB: word/scripture/WEB/ (source of decoded text)
#   - Glossary: word/glossary/biblical/ (term definitions)
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# OPERATIONAL (Contextual)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# # Blocking Status
#
# [OMIT: Data file — translation is declarative, not executable]
#
# # Health Scoring
#
# Configuration Impact: Invalid mapping would confuse translation lookups
#
# Validation Behavior:
#   - Missing KJV term: Warning — incomplete mapping
#   - Missing WEB term: Warning — incomplete mapping
#   - Invalid mapping: Error — both sides must be valid

# 1. Pronoun Mapping - Archaic → Modern
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Verify translation file is correctly formatted:
#
#   # Syntax check (TOML parser)
#   python -c "import tomllib; f=open('word/core/translation.toml','rb'); tomllib.load(f)"
#
# Translation verification:
#   - All pronouns must have: kjv, web, note
#   - All verb forms must have: kjv, web, pattern, note
#   - All vocabulary must have: kjv, web, note
#   - All phrases must have: kjv, web, context
#   - All theological terms must have: kjv, web, status, note
#   - Bidirectional lookup must work both ways

# 3. Policy - Modification
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# NEVER Modify:
#   ❌ KJV text — canonical translation
#   ❌ WEB text — established modern translation
#   ❌ Theological terms — doctrinal significance
#   ❌ Status designations — carefully determined
#
# Safe to Add:
#   ✅ Additional archaic words not yet mapped
#   ✅ Additional phrase mappings
#   ✅ Notes and clarifications
#   ✅ Scripture references for context
#
# Requires Coordination:
#   ⚠️ Adding theological terms (doctrinal implications)
#   ⚠️ Changing status (preserved/changed) designations
#   ⚠️ Modifying reference verses
#

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 4. Synthesis - Closing Note
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# This file bridges encoded (KJV) and decoded (WEB) Scripture.
#
# KJV as Encoded:
#   - Archaic language preserves formal precision
#   - "Thee/thou" distinguishes singular from plural (you/ye)
#   - Verb conjugations mark person explicitly
#   - Vocabulary carries weight of history
#
# WEB as Decoded:
#   - Modern language for accessibility
#   - Clear meaning without linguistic barriers
#   - Suitable for those new to Scripture
#   - Maintains accuracy while improving clarity
#
# The pattern matches OmniCode philosophy:
#   - Encoded form (KJV) = preserved, formal, precise
#   - Decoded form (WEB) = accessible, clear, readable
#   - Both say the same truth, different accessibility levels
#
# Related files:
#   - encoding.toml: Scripture → OmniCode (syntax derivation)
#   - decoding.toml: OmniCode → Scripture (reverse lookup)
#   - translation.toml: KJV ↔ WEB (you are here)
#
# "For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept;
#  line upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little."
# — Isaiah 28:10 KJV
#
# Truth is layered. Encoding and decoding reveal different facets
# of the same unchanging Word.
