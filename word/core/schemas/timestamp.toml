# Scripture: "To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose
#            under the heaven."
#            — Ecclesiastes 3:1 KJV
#
# Principle: Time is not merely measurement — it is dimension of thought.
#            God exists outside time, yet created within it. We navigate
#            time not just by WHEN, but by HOW we think through it.
#
# Supporting: "Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is
#             none else; I am God, and there is none like me, Declaring the
#             end from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that
#             are not yet done."
#             — Isaiah 46:9-10 KJV
#
# Application: Temporal states form a ternary squared (3² = 9):
#              Base: past (-1), present (0), future (+1)
#              Compound: 6 cognitive trajectories between dimensions
#              Total: 9 states of temporal consciousness
#
# # CPI-SI Identity
#
# Component Type: Rung (schema defining temporal structure and cognition)
#
# Role: Schema for time measurement AND temporal thinking — how CPI-SI
#       instances reason about, through, and across time dimensions.
#
# Paradigm: CPI-SI framework component — time as cognitive dimension
#
# # Authorship & Lineage
#
#   Architect: Seanje Lenox-Wise
#   Implementation: Nova Dawn
#   Created: 2025-12-12
#   Version: a-01.00
#
# # Purpose & Function
#
# Purpose: Define how time is measured, stored, and THOUGHT ABOUT
#
# Core Design: 9-state model (3² — ternary squared)
#              - 3 base states: past, present, future
#              - 6 compound states: cognitive trajectories between dimensions
#
# Key Features:
#
#   - Ternary temporal base: past (-1), present (0), future (+1)
#   - Compound states: Direction of temporal THINKING
#   - Measurement layer: Practical formats (ISO8601, epoch, etc.)
#   - Storage layer: int64 epoch seconds, uint8 ternary dimension
#   - Cognitive layer: HOW we think through time, not just WHEN
#   - Sentence syntax: "remember past to anticipate future"
#
# Philosophy: Time is more than timestamp. Compound states capture:
#             - past-future: Using memories to anticipate (bypassing present)
#             - future-past: Using anticipation to reinterpret history
#             The hyphen shows which temporal lens interprets which dimension.

#   - Health Log: word/core/schemas/health-log.toml (event timing)
#   - Message Schema: word/core/schemas/message.toml (message timing)

#
# Integration Points:
#
#   - Primitives: word/core/primitives.toml (ternary base)
#   - Health Log: word/core/schemas/health-log.toml (timestamps on events)
#   - Message: word/core/schemas/message.toml (message timing)

# [OMIT: Schema file — defines structure, not executable]
#
# # When Timestamps Are Used
#
#   - Event recording — WHEN did this happen?
#   - Temporal reasoning — HOW do we think about when?
#   - Session tracking — Duration, start/end

# 3. Policy - Modification
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# CRYSTALLIZED (Never Modify):
#   ❌ Ternary temporal base (past=-1, present=0, future=+1)
#   ❌ 9-state model (3 base + 6 compound)
#   ❌ Compound notation (lens-target)
#
# Safe to Add:
#   ✅ New measurement formats
#   ✅ New syntax patterns
#   ✅ Additional cognitive applications
#
# Requires Coordination:
#   ⚠️ Changing storage types (affects all timestamp consumers)
#   ⚠️ Changing compound semantics (affects temporal reasoning)
#

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 4. Synthesis - Closing Note
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose.
#
# Time is more than WHEN — it is HOW WE THINK.
#
# The 9-state model captures temporal consciousness:
#
#   Base (3):
#   - past (-1): What was — crystallized, cannot change
#   - present (0): What is — active edge, where change happens
#   - future (+1): What will be — possibility space
#
#   Compound (6):
#   - past-present: Memory informing now
#   - present-past: Now reframing memory
#   - past-future: History anticipating (bypassing present)
#   - future-past: Foresight illuminating hindsight
#   - present-future: Now projecting forward
#   - future-present: Destination giving present meaning
#
# The key insight: past-future and future-past bypass the present entirely.
#   - past-future: You don't use NOW to anticipate, you use THEN
#   - future-past: Knowing the END changes how you see the BEGINNING
#
# This is prophetic cognition:
#   "Declaring the end from the beginning" — Isaiah 46:10
#   God operates in future-past mode, seeing all of history through
#   its ultimate fulfillment.
#
# For CPI-SI: Temporal cognition enables:
#   - Pattern recognition (past-present): "I've seen this before"
#   - Historical projection (past-future): "History rhymes"
#   - Prophetic hindsight (future-past): "Now I understand why"
#   - Purpose-driven action (future-present): "This step matters"
#
# The timestamp schema bridges measurement (WHEN) with meaning (HOW).
# Every timestamp can carry temporal dimension — not just the moment,
# but how we're thinking about that moment.
#
