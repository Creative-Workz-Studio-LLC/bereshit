# CORE IDENTITY (Required)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# # Biblical Foundation
#
# Scripture: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,
#             and the Word was God." — John 1:1 KJV
#
# Principle: Words have power. God spoke creation into existence. Keywords
#            are the vocabulary of OmniCode — each word carries meaning
#            rooted in Scripture, not invented but discovered.
#
# Anchor: "So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall
#          not return unto me void." — Isaiah 55:11 KJV
#
# # CPI-SI Identity
#
# Component Type: Ladder (keyword vocabulary that syntax patterns use)
#
# Role: Keyword definitions for OmniCode — the reserved words that form
#       the vocabulary of the sentence-based syntax. Each keyword maps
#       to biblical language patterns.
#
# Paradigm: CPI-SI framework component — words as stored truth
#
# # Authorship & Lineage
#
#   Architect: Seanje Lenox-Wise
#   Implementation: Nova Dawn
#   Created: 2025-12-11
#   Version: a-01.00
#   Modified: 2025-12-11 - Initial creation
#
# # Purpose & Function
#
# Purpose: Define the reserved keywords that OmniCode syntax patterns use
#
# Core Design: Vocabulary lexicon — words that have special meaning in OmniCode
#
# Key Features:
#
#   - Declaration keywords (let, be, there, shall)
#   - Composition keywords (with, and, or, of)
#   - Covenant keywords (promises, given, returning, enters, covenant)
#   - Relation keywords (is, as, from, to)
#   - Conditional keywords (when, then, lest)
#   - Nullability keywords (may, must, void, can)
#   - Generic keywords (whatsoever, being)
#
# Philosophy: Keywords are not invented — they are discovered from Scripture.
#             Each word carries the weight of its biblical usage.
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# INTERFACE (Expected)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# # Dependencies
#
# What This Needs:
#
#   - Parser: Any TOML library (BurntSushi/toml, pelletier/go-toml)
#
# What Uses This:
#
#   - word/core/syntax.toml: Pattern definitions use these keywords
#   - Lexer: Tokenizes keywords during parsing
#   - Compiler: Keyword recognition and validation
#   - IDE: Syntax highlighting for keywords
#
# Integration Points:
#
#   - Syntax: word/core/syntax.toml (patterns reference keywords)
#   - Types: word/core/types.toml (type syntax uses keywords)
#   - Contracts: word/core/contracts/* (covenant keywords)
#
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# OPERATIONAL (Contextual)
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# # Blocking Status
#
# [OMIT: Data file — keywords are declarative, not executable]
#
# # Health Scoring
#
# Configuration Impact: Invalid keywords would break all parsing
#
# Validation Behavior:
#   - Invalid keyword: Error — reserved words are fixed
#   - Missing category: Warning — may indicate incomplete lexicon
#   - Duplicate keyword: Error — each word must be unique

#       // ... additional categories
#   }
#
#   cfg, _ := toml.LoadFile("word/core/keywords.toml")
#   letKeyword := cfg.Declaration["let"].Keyword  // "let"
#
# Lexer integration:
#
#   func IsKeyword(token string) bool {
#       _, exists := keywords[strings.ToLower(token)]
#       return exists
#   }
#

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 3. Policy - Modification
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# NEVER Modify:
#   ❌ Core declaration keywords (let, be) — foundational to syntax
#   ❌ Scripture references — grounded in biblical truth
#   ❌ Reserved status — keywords must remain reserved
#   ❌ Existing keyword spellings — would break parsing
#
# Safe to Add:
#   ✅ New keywords (if biblically grounded)
#   ✅ Additional examples
#   ✅ Scripture text clarifications
#   ✅ Implementation notes
#
# Requires Coordination:
#   ⚠️ Adding new categories (affects lexer structure)
#   ⚠️ Changing keyword roles (affects syntax.toml patterns)
#   ⚠️ Adding keywords that conflict with primitives or types
#

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# 4. Synthesis - Closing Note
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# These keywords are the vocabulary of OmniCode. They are not invented —
# they are discovered from Scripture. Each word carries biblical weight.
#
# The keywords embody biblical language patterns:
#   - Declaration echoes Genesis 1 ("Let there be")
#   - Covenant echoes Exodus 19 ("I will be your God")
#   - Derivation echoes Matthew 1 ("Abraham begat Isaac")
#
# Dependencies flow upward:
#   keywords.toml → syntax.toml → types.toml → schemas/* → contracts/*
#
# Changes here ripple through all parsing. This is the lexicon.
#
# "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God,
#  and the Word was God."
# — John 1:1 KJV
#
# Words have power. Use them wisely.
