= fundamental-constants

*TIME, SPACE, MATTER* — The three dimensions of created reality revealed in Genesis 1:1.

*Definition:* The fundamental structure of creation as established by God in the first verse of Scripture.

[quote, Genesis 1:1 KJV]
____
In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
____

[cols="^1,2,3,3"]
|===
|Trit |Dimension |Genesis 1:1 |Meaning

|**0**
|*TIME*
|"In the beginning"
|Sequence, causality, anchor — when things happen

|**+1**
|*SPACE*
|"the heavens"
|Position, relationships, build up — where things exist

|**-1**
|*MATTER*
|"the earth"
|Substance, identity, break down — what things are
|===

== The Order Matters

Genesis 1:1 establishes a dependency chain:

* TIME must exist for SPACE to exist within
* SPACE must exist for MATTER to exist within
* The sequence TIME → SPACE → MATTER reflects existential dependency

God exists *before* TIME — "In the beginning" marks when time starts, but God is already present to initiate it.

== Two Directions Through the Structure

[quote, Isaiah 55:9 KJV]
____
For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.
____

The same three dimensions can be traversed in two directions:

[cols="2,3,3"]
|===
|Direction |Order |Meaning

|*Creation (God's way)*
|TIME → SPACE → MATTER
|Top-down: from eternity into existence, abstract to concrete

|*Implementation (our way)*
|MATTER → SPACE → TIME
|Bottom-up: from concrete toward understanding, building up
|===

His ways are higher because He starts from the foundation of existence itself. We start from what we can perceive (matter) and build toward understanding.

== Where the Directions Meet

The Bible is where revelation (God reaching down) and understanding (us reaching up) meet. This is why Scripture is the rail — it bridges the gap between His starting point and ours.

== Usage in CWS

[cols="1,2"]
|===
|Context |Application

|*Ternary logic*
|Three values (-1, 0, +1) reflect three fundamental dimensions

|*Implementation order*
|Start with types (MATTER), establish relationships (SPACE), express through operations (TIME)

|*Testing pattern*
|Demo tests Matter, Space, Time dimensions to prove system reflects created order

|*Validation*
|When ternary "just works," we're uncovering created structure, not inventing
