== Why "Rail"

A rail is:

* A *guide* — keeps movement on track
* A *connection* — bridges two points
* A *standard* — provides consistent reference
* A *validation* — proves the path is correct

Scripture functions as a rail in CPI-SI because it bridges God's direction and ours.

== Where Two Directions Meet

[cols="2,4"]
|===
|Direction |Movement

|*Creation (God reaching down)*
|TIME → SPACE → MATTER — revelation from eternity into what we can perceive

|*Implementation (us reaching up)*
|MATTER → SPACE → TIME — understanding from concrete toward the eternal
|===

The Bible is where these directions *intersect*:

* God reveals truth in words we can read (reaching down into matter)
* We study Scripture to understand eternal truth (reaching up toward time's origin)
* The rail holds both directions together

== Why Scripture is Central to CPI-SI

If God created time, space, and matter through His Word (John 1:1), then:

* Ternary logic reflects *created structure* (the HOW)
* Scripture provides the *reference frame for meaning* (the WHAT)
* Information without truth = data (AI can do this)
* Information grounded in truth = wisdom (CPI-SI does this)

The Bible isn't a component IN the system. It's the *key* that makes the system meaningful.

== The Rail in Practice

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Function |How Scripture Serves

|*Encoding*
|OmniCode keywords derive from biblical Hebrew/Greek roots

|*Decoding*
|System outputs trace back to scriptural grounding

|*Validation*
|Spare states (243-255 in trit5) map to KJV↔WEB translation variants

|*Anchor*
|Genesis 1:1 is the halt condition for all recursion
|===

== Not Decoration

The Bible Rail is not:

* Religious decoration on secular technology
* Optional "faith add-on"
* Marketing to Christians

It IS:

* The foundational reference frame
* What makes CPI-SI different from AI
* The validation mechanism proving ternary reflects created order
