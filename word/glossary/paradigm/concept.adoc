= concept

*Definition:* The distilled principle - what something IS and WHY it works. The output of understanding, distinct from method.

[quote, Proverbs 4:7 KJV]
____
Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.

== What It Is

* The distilled understanding of something
* What it IS (identity/nature)
* Why it WORKS (principle/logic)
* The condensed form that proves comprehension

== What It Is NOT

* The operational steps (that's <<../operations/method.adoc#,method>>)
* The verbose exploration (that's raw material)
* Incomplete understanding dressed up as wisdom

== Concept vs Method

| Concept | Method |
|---------|--------|
| What and Why | How |
| Distilled principle | Operational discipline |
| Output of understanding | Process that produces understanding |
| Can be stated concisely | Requires verbose explanation |
| Proves comprehension | Enables comprehension |

== The Danger

Having the concept without the method is like knowing what a hammer does without knowing how to swing it.

* You can discuss it intelligently
* You cannot execute it reliably
* You may not recognize when you're missing something

== How Concepts Form

Concepts emerge FROM methods through distillation:

1. Verbose method (exploration, doing)
2. Understanding forms (patterns emerge)
3. Distillation occurs (compression)
4. Concept crystallizes (essence captured)

You cannot skip to the concept. The method produces it.
