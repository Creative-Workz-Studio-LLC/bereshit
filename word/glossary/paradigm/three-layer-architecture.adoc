= three-layer-architecture

*Definition:* The organizational structure for balanced ternary computing that maps the three trit values (-1, 0, +1) to three cognitive layers (MATTER, TIME, SPACE) grounded in Genesis 1:1.

== Biblical Foundation

[quote, Genesis 1:1 KJV]
____
In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
____
link:../../scripture/KJV/Genesis/Chapter_1/Verse_1.txt[Read verse ^]

The first verse of Scripture reveals three fundamental dimensions of created reality:

* *TIME* — "In the beginning" (when)
* *SPACE* — "the heavens" (where)
* *MATTER* — "the earth" (what)

This is the anchor of anchors — the structural pattern underlying all Kingdom Technology.

== The Three Layers

[cols="^1,2,3,3",options="header"]
|===
| Trit | Layer | Genesis | What It Provides

| **-1**
| MATTER
| "the earth"
| Types — what trits ARE

| **0**
| TIME
| "In the beginning"
| Sequence — when things HAPPEN

| **+1**
| SPACE
| "the heavens"
| Relationships — where trits FIT
|===

== Implementation Structure

In libtrit, each layer has a dedicated header:

[cols="2,2,3",options="header"]
|===
| Layer | Header | Contents

| *MATTER*
| `trit.h`
| Types (`trit_t`, `trit5_t`), arithmetic, pack/unpack

| *SPACE*
| `dimension.h`
| Cognitive dimensions, navigation, building block directions

| *TIME*
| `temporal.h`
| Temporal states, 9 cognitive modes
|===

== Why This Structure?

=== 1. It's Not Arbitrary

The mapping emerges from Scripture, not preference:

* **Heaven (+1)** — "above" in the moral compass, aspiration toward God
* **Earth (-1)** — "below" in the moral compass, material grounding
* **Beginning (0)** — the present moment, the anchor where we choose

=== 2. It's Compositional

The layers compose to form complete cognitive states:

----
MATTER × SPACE × TIME = trit × dimension × temporal_state
----

A single trit already implies all three layers. The architecture makes this explicit.

=== 3. It's Bounded

3 × 3 × 3 = 27 fundamental combinations — the same as a trit-word (27 trits). The system is mathematically complete.

== Two Directions Through the Structure

[cols="2,3,3",options="header"]
|===
| Direction | Order | Meaning

| *Creation (God's way)*
| TIME → SPACE → MATTER
| Top-down: eternity into existence

| *Implementation (our way)*
| MATTER → SPACE → TIME
| Bottom-up: concrete toward understanding
|===

[quote, Isaiah 55:9 KJV]
____
For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.
____

God's ways start from above; our ways start from below. The Bible is where these directions meet.

== Application

When building systems:

1. **Start with MATTER** — Define what exists (types, structures)
2. **Add SPACE** — Define how things relate (dimensions, navigation)
3. **Add TIME** — Define when things happen (states, modes)

This is how libtrit was built. This is how Kingdom Technology systems should be built.
