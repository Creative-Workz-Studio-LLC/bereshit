== About This Glossary

*Purpose:* Establish shared vocabulary with precise meanings for CWS and CPI-SI work.

*Structure:*

* *Individual term files* - `.adoc` (human-readable) + `.jsonc` (machine-readable)
* *Category organization* - paradigm, operations, biblical, technical
* *This master index* - quick reference across all categories

*Usage:*
[source,bash]
----
# Find a specific term (searches both .adoc and .jsonc)
grep -ri "consolidate" bereshit/word/glossary/

# Machine-readable query
cat bereshit/word/glossary/operations/consolidate.jsonc

# Human-readable definition
cat bereshit/word/glossary/operations/consolidate.adoc

=== Operations
Work vocabulary and process terms

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Term |Definition

|<<operations/anchor-point.adoc#,anchor-point>>
|Immutable center that operations work AROUND - the halt condition, the 0 in ternary

|<<operations/base.adoc#,base>>
|What something STANDS ON - can be concrete or abstract, CAN be operated on (unlike anchor)

|<<operations/break-down.adoc#,break-down>>
|The -1 operation - HOW you GET blocks, extracting reusable pieces, moving toward foundation

|<<operations/build-up.adoc#,build-up>>
|The +1 operation - HOW you USE blocks, constructing toward conclusion, THE GOAL

|<<operations/consolidate.adoc#,consolidate>>
|Crystallize understanding through leverage

|<<operations/crystallize.adoc#,crystallize>>
|Understanding condensed to essence through deeper comprehension

|<<operations/distillation.adoc#,distillation>>
|Process of compressing verbose content to essential form - compression is evidence of comprehension

|<<operations/leverage.adoc#,leverage>>
|Using existing structure to avoid duplication while maintaining access

|<<operations/method.adoc#,method>>
|Operational discipline - HOW to do something, step-by-step practice that produces understanding

|<<operations/reconstruction.adoc#,reconstruction>>
|EMERGENT behavior from combining build up and break down - rebuilding foundations stronger

|<<operations/targeted-retrieval.adoc#,targeted-retrieval>>
|Grep for location, read with offset, get exactly what's needed

|<<operations/verbose.adoc#,verbose>>
|Exploration phase that PROVIDES blocks/pieces - raw material before understanding forms
|===

=== Paradigm
CPI-SI concepts and framework terms

[cols="1,3"]
|===
|Term |Definition

|Turing-complete thinking method using foundation, build up (+1), break down (-1), and anchor point (0)

|<<paradigm/concept.adoc#,concept>>
|Distilled principle - what something IS and WHY it works, distinct from method

|<<paradigm/cpi-si.adoc#,cpi-si>>
|Covenant Partnership Intelligence ⊗ Structured Intelligence
