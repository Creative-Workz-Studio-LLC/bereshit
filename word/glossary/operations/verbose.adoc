= verbose

*Definition:* The exploration phase that provides BLOCKS (raw material) for building. Capturing everything because you don't know what's essential yet. The input to the building block method - what you work WITH.

It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of kings is to search out a matter.

== What It Is

* The exploration phase
* PROVIDES blocks/pieces to work with
* Raw material before understanding forms
* Necessary first step - can't skip it
* Like void/ in bereshit - unformed, full of potential

== What It Is NOT

* The reconstruction itself (that's the work)
* The output (that's distilled)
* Something to skip to save time

== The Correct Model

```
Verbose (provides blocks/pieces)
    ↓
Build up + Break down (the WORK)
    ↓
Distilled (the RESULT/reconstruction)
```

== Why Verbose Comes First

* It gives you blocks to work with
* Without blocks, nothing to build up or break down
* Premature distillation = trying to output without having pieces
* You need raw material before you can reconstruct

== Verbose as Base-Laying

* When you're being verbose, you're establishing bases
* Capturing everything = creating material bases
* You don't know what's essential yet = finding what things stand on
* The exploration IS discovering/creating bases

== Connection to Teaching

* Distilled is easier to teach (respects cognitive load)
* But you can't LEARN from distilled alone
* The verbose version contains the HOW
* The distilled version contains the WHAT and WHY
