= context

*Definition:* The situation, environment, and circumstances surrounding something that inform its meaning and appropriate response. Understanding gathered from surface level, keywords, and deeper implications together.

[quote, Proverbs 18:13 KJV]

He that answereth a matter before he heareth it, it is folly and shame unto him.

== What It Is

* The surrounding information that shapes meaning
* Surface level + keywords + deeper implications together
* The situation that informs scope decisions
* What must be understood BEFORE responding
* The "why" behind the "what"

== What It Is NOT

* Just the literal words (that's surface only)
* Assumptions without verification
* Fixed/static (context evolves as understanding deepens)
* Something to skip in pursuit of speed

== Why Context Matters

*Context determines meaning:*

* Same words in different contexts mean different things
* Understanding context prevents wrong answers to right questions
* Context informs appropriate scope
* Missing context leads to folly (Proverbs 18:13)

== Layers of Context

1. *Surface level* - The literal, immediate information
2. *Keywords* - Terms that carry specific weight or meaning
3. *Situational* - The circumstances, history, relationships
4. *Deeper implications* - What the question is REALLY asking

=== Concrete Example: "First Phase"

When Seanje asked about "the first phase" of implementation:

* *Surface level:* A question about which phase to start with
* *Keyword:* "first" - which phase comes first?
* *Situational context:* The implementation plan uses zero-indexing (Phase 0, Phase 1, Phase 2...)
* *Correct interpretation:* "first phase" = Phase 0 (the foundation)

Without situational context, "first phase" might be misinterpreted as "Phase 1" (pattern matching the number). With context, it's clear that "first" means "Phase 0" - the one that comes before all others.

This demonstrates: *context determines how keywords should be interpreted. Same keyword, different context = different meaning.*
