= scope

*Definition:* The intentional, adjustable boundaries defining what IS included versus what ISN'T. The separation (badal) that enables focus. Can be over-scoped (too broad) or under-scoped (too limited). Informed by context - as understanding deepens, scope may need revision.

And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.

== What It Is

* The boundary between IN and OUT
* Intentional constraint that enables depth over breadth
* The separation (badal) applied to work
* What's included in current work vs deferred/delegated
* The frame that defines focus
* A DECISION, not a discovery - you choose where the boundary is
* Tunable - can be extended or contracted as understanding deepens

== What It Is NOT

* Arbitrary limitation
* Everything possible (that's scopelessness)
* Something imposed externally without understanding
* Fixed/permanent (scope adjusts with context)
* Binary right/wrong (can be over OR under-scoped)

== Scope States

[cols="1,2"]
|===
|State |Meaning

|*Under-scoped (limited)*
|Boundary drawn too small - missing what should be IN

|*Over-scoped (expanded)*
|Boundary drawn too large - including what should be OUT

|*Right-scoped*
|Boundary appropriate to the actual work
|===

*The key insight:* Limited scope isn't WRONG scope - it may be appropriate for a sub-task. But understanding when scope needs extension or contraction is wisdom.

== Why Scope Matters

*Without scope, work scatters:*

* No boundaries = no focus = shallow work everywhere
* Scope enables depth by excluding distraction
* Defines what success looks like (did we complete what's IN scope?)
* Prevents drift from anchor
