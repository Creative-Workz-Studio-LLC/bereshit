= scope

*Definition:* The boundaries that define what IS included versus what ISN'T. The separation (badal) that enables focus. The intentional decision about what's included in the current work versus what's deferred, delegated, or out of bounds.

And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the light from the darkness.

== What It Is

* The boundary between IN and OUT
* Intentional constraint that enables depth over breadth
* The separation (badal) applied to work
* What's included in current work vs deferred/delegated
* The frame that defines focus

== What It Is NOT

* Arbitrary limitation
* Everything possible (that's scopelessness)
* Something imposed externally without understanding
* A fixed permanent constraint (scope can be adjusted intentionally)

== Why Scope Matters

*Without scope, work scatters:*

* No boundaries = no focus = shallow work everywhere
* Scope enables depth by excluding distraction
* Defines what success looks like (did we complete what's IN scope?)
* Prevents drift from anchor
