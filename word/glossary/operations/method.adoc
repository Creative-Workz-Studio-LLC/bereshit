= method

*Definition:* The operational discipline - HOW to actually do something. The step-by-step practice that produces understanding and enables execution.

[quote, Exodus 25:40 KJV]
____
And look that thou make them after their pattern, which was shewed thee in the mount.

== What It Is

* The operational discipline (HOW)
* Step-by-step procedure
* The verbose, practical process
* What you actually DO to achieve something

== What It Is NOT

* The distilled principle (that's <<../paradigm/concept.adoc#,concept>>)
* A shortcut around doing the work
* Something you can skip to get to the concept faster

== Why Method Matters

Having the concept without the method is incomplete understanding:

* You know WHAT something is
* You don't know HOW to do it
* You cannot reliably execute
* You cannot teach others properly

The method is the foundation under the concept.

== Method vs Concept

| Method | Concept |
|--------|---------|
| How | What and Why |
| Operational discipline | Distilled principle |
| Process that produces understanding | Output of understanding |
| Requires verbose explanation | Can be stated concisely |
| Enables comprehension | Proves comprehension |

== The Pattern

God showed Moses the pattern (concept) AND the method (how to build):

* The pattern alone was not enough
* Detailed instructions were given
* Following the method produced the result
* The method honored the pattern

== Why Verboseness Is Necessary

Methods are verbose because:

1. Each step must be explicit
2. Edge cases must be addressed
3. The learner doesn't know what's essential yet
4. Understanding emerges through following the steps

The verboseness IS the learning. Premature compression loses information needed to truly understand.
