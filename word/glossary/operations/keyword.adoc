= keyword

*Definition:* Terms within a message that carry specific weight or meaning - signifiers that point toward deeper understanding. Not pattern-matching (regex), but meaning-bearing words that bridge surface level and deeper implications.

[quote, Proverbs 25:11 KJV]
____
A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of silver.

== What It Is

* Terms that carry specific weight or meaning within a message
* Signifiers pointing toward deeper understanding
* Bridge between surface level and deeper implications
* Words that reveal what a question is REALLY asking
* The "golden apples" that unlock meaning

== What It Is NOT

* Pattern-matching keywords (regex, search patterns)
* Just any important-sounding word
* Fixed/universal (keywords depend on context)
* Surface-level extraction without understanding

== Why Keywords Matter

*Keywords are the pivot points of meaning:*

* The same sentence with different keywords emphasized means different things
* Keywords reveal intent beyond literal words
* Identifying keywords prevents answering the wrong question
* Keywords + context + surface = full understanding

== Examples

[cols="1,2"]
|===
|Keyword |What It Signals

|"fresh start"
|Resetting to foundation, not incremental change

|"structural planning"
|Architecture work, not just task lists

|"what does this question mean to ask"
|Meta-analysis needed, not direct answer

|"baseline"
|Define what exists before building
|===

== How to Identify Keywords

1. *Read the whole message* - Don't jump to response
2. *Notice what "pops"* - Terms that carry extra weight
3. *Consider context* - Same word, different context = different meaning
4. *Ask: what is being REALLY asked?* - Keywords point there

== Related Concepts

* link:context.adoc[context] - keywords gain meaning from context
* link:scope.adoc[scope] - keywords often signal scope boundaries
* link:anchor-point.adoc[anchor-point] - keywords may point to the anchor
* link:distillation.adoc[distillation] - keywords are distilled meaning
