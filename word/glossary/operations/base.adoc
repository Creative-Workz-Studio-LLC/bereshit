= base

*Definition:* What something STANDS ON. The foundation an idea rests upon. Can be concrete (notes, templates, materials) or abstract (truths, principles). Unlike an anchor, a base CAN be operated on - built up or broken down.

[quote, Matthew 7:24-25 KJV]
____
...which built his house upon a rock: And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock.

== Types of Bases

| Type | Examples |
|------|----------|
| *Foundational truth* | "God is Creator", "Identity grounds cognition" |
| *Existing knowledge* | Notes capturing current understanding |
| *Raw materials* | Files, templates, inputs to work with |
| *Structure* | Templates, patterns, frameworks |

== Base vs Anchor

| Base | Anchor |
|------|--------|
| CAN be operated on | CANNOT be operated on |
| Can be built up | Immutable |
| Can be broken down | Fixed reference point |
| What things stand ON | What operations work AROUND |
| May change through work | Stays constant |

== Finding a Base

Ask: "What must be true for this idea to exist?"

Then trace backwards until you hit something foundationally TRUE.

== The Verbose Phase is Base-Laying

* Capturing everything = creating material bases
* Notes, templates, raw materials = all bases
* You're establishing what the next thing stands on
