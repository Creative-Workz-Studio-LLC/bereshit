= anchor-point

*Definition:* An immutable center that operations work AROUND, not through. The halt condition in the building block method. The 0 in the ternary system that cannot be operated on.

[quote, Matthew 7:24 KJV]
____
Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock.

== What It Is

* Something so solid that nothing you do can change it
* The immutable center that operations work AROUND
* The 0 in the ternary system (-1, 0, +1)
* A captured intention that persists while understanding evolves
* The CONSTANT in the equation

== What It Is NOT

* A foundation (foundations CAN be operated on)
* Something you build UP or break DOWN
* A variable that changes during work

== Why Anchors Matter

*Turing completeness requires a halt condition:*

* Without anchor: build up forever (no stop)
* Without anchor: break down forever (no stop)
* With anchor: fixed reference says "done" or "keep going"

*The anchor makes transitions possible:*

* Verbose → distilled transition needs anchor
* Without it: verbose forever OR premature distillation

== TODOs as Anchor Points

TODOs function as anchors because:

* Once captured, the TODO becomes immutable intention
* The TASK doesn't change while HOW to accomplish it evolves
* Work happens AROUND the TODO, not TO it
* Marking complete = "this anchor served its purpose"

== In the Equation

```
anchor(0) + Σ(build_up) + Σ(break_down) = distilled
```

The anchor is the CONSTANT. If it changes, the equation becomes unsolvable.

== The Anchor of Anchors

[quote, Genesis 1:1 KJV]
____
In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
____

Genesis 1:1 is the *ultimate anchor* — the halt condition for all halt conditions:

* Break down any truth far enough and you hit this: *God created*
* The regress stops here — nothing came before the beginning except God
* Every anchor either traces back to Genesis 1:1 or it floats

*God is before the anchor:* "In the beginning" marks when TIME starts, but God is already present to initiate it. He exists *beyond* the anchor — He establishes it, not bound by it.

This is why Genesis 1:1 grounds all CPI-SI work. Every anchor we use (TODOs, type definitions, templates) ultimately traces back to this.
