= block-by-block

*Definition:* Workflow approach where each block is a unit of work - edit an entire block, then move to the next. Not section-by-section within blocks, not wholesale across all blocks.

Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the priests, and they builded the sheep gate...

== The Insight

Blocks are *atomic units*. You can edit an entire block as one operation, then move to the next. This works because link:../technical/boundary-marker.adoc[boundary markers] make blocks addressable.

== What It Is

* Each block is a unit of work
* Edit entire block, then move to next
* Blocks are addressable via boundary markers
* Linux tools can operate on block boundaries

== What It Is NOT

* Section-by-section within a block (too granular)
* Wholesale across all blocks at once (too broad)
* Line-by-line editing (loses block context)
* Ignoring block boundaries (loses structure)

== Why It Works

[cols="1,2"]
|===
|Capability |How

|*Blocks are findable*
|`grep -n 'BLOCK NAME' file` finds boundaries

|*Blocks are extractable*
|`sed -n '/START/,/END/p' file` gets the block

|*Blocks are replaceable*
|Edit tool can replace entire block content

|*Blocks are validatable*
|Each block checked independently
|===

== Workflow Steps

1. Identify which block to work on
2. Find block boundaries (`grep` for markers)
3. Edit the entire block as a unit
4. Verify block is complete
5. Move to next block

== What This Enables

* *Targeted editing* - without loading full file
* *Batch operations* - across multiple files
* *Independent validation* - per block
* *Clean separation* - of concerns
