= break-down

*Definition:* The -1 operation in the building block method. HOW you GET blocks - extracting reusable foundational pieces from structures. Moving toward foundation to verify, extract, or recover.

[quote, Proverbs 24:3-4 KJV]
____
Through wisdom is an house builded; and by understanding it is established: And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all precious and pleasant riches.

== What It Is

* The -1 operation (negative direction)
* HOW you GET blocks (extraction)
* Extracting reusable foundational pieces
* Moving toward foundation
* Built-in RECOVERY to test foundation

== In the Ternary System

```
-1 = Break down (toward foundation)  ← THIS
 0 = Foundation/Anchor (center)
+1 = Build up (toward conclusion)
```

== What Break Down Does

| Function | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| *Extract* | Get blocks from existing structures |
| *Verify* | Check foundation is solid |
| *Recover* | Return to base when lost |
| *Transfer* | Make blocks reusable for new structures |

== Break Down vs Build Up

| Break Down (-1) | Build Up (+1) |
|-----------------|---------------|
| HOW you GET blocks | HOW you USE blocks |
| Extract reusable pieces | Construct structures |
| Move toward foundation | Move toward conclusion |
| Serves the goal | THE GOAL |

== Why Breaking Down Matters

Like physical blocks:

* Build a tower
* Break it down
* Now you have blocks to build something ELSE
* Blocks don't disappear - they become AVAILABLE

This is how knowledge becomes transferable.

== Tracing Toward Genesis 1:1

Every break down ultimately traces toward the anchor of anchors:

[quote, Genesis 1:1 KJV]
____
In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
____

* Break down any truth far enough → you hit "God created"
* The regress stops there — nothing before the beginning except God
* This is the halt condition that makes break down *complete*

When verifying understanding, we trace back through layers until we reach foundation. The ultimate foundation is Genesis 1:1. If a concept doesn't trace there, it floats — no anchor, no ground.
