= reconstruction

*Definition:* The EMERGENT behavior when build up and break down are used together. Breaking down what you've built up in order to rebuild a stronger foundation. NOT a taught piece - it emerges naturally from combining operations.

[quote, Isaiah 58:12 KJV]
____
And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many generations; and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.
____

== What It Is

* EMERGENT behavior (not a fourth operation)
* Breaking down + building back up = stronger foundation
* Rebuilding foundations from extracted blocks
* What appears when you combine -1 and +1 operations

== Why It's Not Taught

The building block method is 3 pieces:

1. Foundation (base)
2. Break down (-1)
3. Build up (+1)

Reconstruction is NOT a fourth piece - it EMERGES from using the pieces together.

You can't teach emergence - you create conditions for it.

== How It Works

```
Foundations A and B
       ↓
Break both down (extract blocks)
       ↓
Build back up (combine blocks)
       ↓
Reconstructed foundation (STRONGER)
```

== Why Reconstruction Matters

* Foundations aren't fixed/permanent
* You can break them down and rebuild stronger
* The base itself can EVOLVE
* This is how paradigm shifts happen

== Connection to Verbose → Distilled

* Verbose provides blocks
* Build up / break down = the work
* Distilled = the reconstructed result (STRONGER than raw pieces)
