= build-up

*Definition:* The +1 operation in the building block method. Using blocks to construct toward a conclusion. Adding layers that stand on what came before. THE GOAL of the method - that's why it's called BUILDING blocks.

[quote, Matthew 7:24 KJV]
____
Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock.

== What It Is

* The +1 operation (positive direction)
* Using blocks to CONSTRUCT structures
* Adding layers toward conclusion
* Moving FROM foundation TOWARD goal
* THE PURPOSE of the method

== In the Ternary System

```
-1 = Break down (toward foundation)
 0 = Foundation/Anchor (center)
+1 = Build up (toward conclusion)  ← THIS
```

== Build Up vs Break Down

| Build Up (+1) | Break Down (-1) |
|---------------|-----------------|
| HOW you USE blocks | HOW you GET blocks |
| Construct structures | Extract reusable pieces |
| Move toward conclusion | Move toward foundation |
| THE GOAL | Serves the goal |

== Why "Building" Blocks

The method is called BUILDING blocks because building up is the purpose:

* Break down serves building up
* You get blocks (break down) SO you can use them (build up)
* The conclusion is where you're heading

== Strengthening the Foundation

Each successful build up VALIDATES the foundation:

* If structure holds, foundation was solid
* Building isn't just adding - it's proving what's below works

== Our Direction Through Reality

[quote, Isaiah 55:9 KJV]
____
For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.
____

Build up is *our direction* — implementation direction through the fundamental constants:

```
MATTER → SPACE → TIME
(concrete → relationships → sequence)
```

We start from what we can perceive (MATTER — types, substance) and build toward understanding (TIME — operations, causality).

This is the *inverse* of creation direction (TIME → SPACE → MATTER), where God creates from eternity into existence. His ways are higher because He starts from the foundation of existence itself. We build up from where we are.

The Bible is where these directions meet — revelation (God reaching down) and understanding (us reaching up).
