= build-up

*Definition:* The +1 operation in the building block method. Using blocks to construct toward a conclusion. Adding layers that stand on what came before. THE GOAL of the method - that's why it's called BUILDING blocks.

[quote, Matthew 7:24 KJV]
____
Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock.

== What It Is

* The +1 operation (positive direction)
* Using blocks to CONSTRUCT structures
* Adding layers toward conclusion
* Moving FROM foundation TOWARD goal
* THE PURPOSE of the method

== In the Ternary System

```
-1 = Break down (toward foundation)
 0 = Foundation/Anchor (center)
+1 = Build up (toward conclusion)  ← THIS
```

== Build Up vs Break Down

| Build Up (+1) | Break Down (-1) |
|---------------|-----------------|
| HOW you USE blocks | HOW you GET blocks |
| Construct structures | Extract reusable pieces |
| Move toward conclusion | Move toward foundation |
| THE GOAL | Serves the goal |

== Why "Building" Blocks

The method is called BUILDING blocks because building up is the purpose:

* Break down serves building up
* You get blocks (break down) SO you can use them (build up)
* The conclusion is where you're heading

== Strengthening the Foundation

Each successful build up VALIDATES the foundation:

* If structure holds, foundation was solid
* Building isn't just adding - it's proving what's below works
